                <p>Hi everyone, welcome to my portofolio website. My name is Rizal Fahri Irawna, born on 19 January 2004 in Wonosobo.
                    I am an active, hard-working, and enthusiastic individual in the field of information technology. 
                    I possess the ability to work both in a team and independently, 
                    and I always strive to complete tasks with quality and in a timely manner. 
                    I also have a good command of the English language. 
                    I hope to join a company that prioritizes innovation and technology development, 
                    where I can contribute and expand my knowledge and experience.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="db-2">
                <p>I recently graduated from a technical high school majoring in Software Engineering in 2022 with satisfactory grades.
                    During my high school years, I learned various technologies and programming languages, such as Java and C++. 
                    I also participated in extracurricular activities related to information technology,
                    such as programming contests and the IT club. 
                    Currently, I am in my second semester of my computer science degree program at PGRI University Yogyakarta.
                    Here, I deepen my knowledge and find solutions to problems in technology.</p> 
                    <p>As part of my education program, I completed a 6-month on-the-job training (OJT) at BLK Kebumen. 
                    I was placed on the software development team and had the opportunity to learn and apply the knowledge I gained during my high school training. 
                    I understand how a company manages and develops software and helped the team complete various tasks. 
                    During my OJT, I also had the opportunity to work with the team to solve technical problems and ensure that the quality of the application meets industry standards. 
                    I am confident that this experience will be greatly beneficial for my career in the information technology field.
